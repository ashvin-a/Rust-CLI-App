**"The Summit Within"** By **ChatGPT**

Climb, though the road is steep and wide,
With dreams as stars, your constant guide.
Let thunder roar, let tempests spin—
You were not made to break, but win.

Each dawn you rise, though weary feet
Have walked through fire, faced cold defeat.
Still in your chest, a steady drum—
A whisper strong: *your time will come.*

Not every crown is made of gold,
Not every tale of glory told.
But every heart that dares to try
Will write its name across the sky.

You’ve battled doubt, you’ve danced with fear,
But still you stand, you still are here.
That’s not just living—*that’s a fight.*
That’s what it means to chase the light.

So lift your chin, take one more stride,
Let purpose be your only guide.
The world may push, the dark may call—
But you were born to rise through all.

Win not by chance, but by design—
With grit and grace, your soul will shine.
Life bows to those who won’t give in…
The prize is yours—*now go, and win.*
